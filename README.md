# Restaurant Menu Project
In this project I wanted to challenge myself on using grids and other various coding practices that I have learnt to create and style a restaurant menu for a simple garden centre. The idea was to take a restaurant menu that didn't have a HTML page on their website and turn it into a working and functioning website by using different grid CSS styles.

When creating this website I wanted to use my own restaurant name with its own logo, so as not to get in trouble for copyright or anything. As the restaurant is completely manufactured and is not a real menu, image place-holders are used and would be replaced with a photograph of an example of that menu item.

I used different grid layouts within the project which may have resulted in an inconsistent layout, but as the website was created to challenge myself, I thought the best way to do this was to use various different styling methods to get the best learning experience.

I'm still very new to HTML and CSS and don't think the website is perfect and still has a lot of room for improvement with better code layout, styling and removing unnecessary code, ect. However I'm happy how far my coding has come and have learnt a lot from after making it, I will use that knowledge and take it onto the next project.
